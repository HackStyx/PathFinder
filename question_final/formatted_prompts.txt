I am a student with a CGPA of 8.3, and I have completed courses in dbms. My preferred field is ml, and my learning style is visual. I would like to know what career goals I should aim for based on my academic performance and interests. My marks in DSA are 99, DBMS are 88, ML are 77, and Microcontroller are 66. Can you suggest some relevant courses on Coursera or Udemy that align with my goals and interests? Can you give me some insights on what career goals I should aim for based on my academic performance and interests?
